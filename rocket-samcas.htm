<h1><a href=samcas-implementation.htm><img class=hdr src=img/sam-flow.jpg></a><span>Simple Rocket Launcher Demonstration</span></h1>
<p>This is an implementation of <b>Rocket Launcher</b> used as an example at <a href=https://sam.js.org>sam.js.org</a></p>
<p>The Pause option was added because it added more complexity and permutations to the state machine.</p>
<div>This implementation has the following characteristics:
  <ul class=sam>
    <li>The implementation uses about 80 lines of code including template wrapper comments, CSS and HTML but excluding the support javaScript that
       builds the model complex and runs the state/action transitions.
    </li>
    <li>The support javascript code is less than 1K of commented code lines plus about 700 commented lines for mustache.js.  No other libaries are needed. No JQuery, Knockout or Vue.</li>
    <li>The model complex is a component and can be incorporated into other SAM complexes. Refer to <a href=missiles-samcas.htm>Missile Site</a> for a working example.</li>
  </ul>
