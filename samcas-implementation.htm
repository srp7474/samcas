<h1><a href=http://stevepritchard.ca><img class=hdr src=img/sam-flow.jpg></a><span>A Cascaded SAM Implementation by Steve Pritchard</span></h1>
<p>The SAM (State-Action-Model) pattern proposed by <a href=https://www.infoq.com/profile/Jean~Jacques-Dubray>Jean-Jacques Dubray</a> is explained at <a href=https://sam.js.org>sam.js.org</a></p>

<p>The advance to Jean-Jacques Dubray's SAM pattern presented here is the added notion of <b>cascading</b> the SAM complexes such that they can have a parent/child relationship.</p>

<p>A working Rocket example using this implemenation can be seen at <a href=rocket-samcas.htm>Rocket Example</a>.
The Pause option was added because it added more complexity and permutations to the state machine.
</p>

<p>A working cascaded example using the Rocket model as a component can be seen at <a href=missiles-samcas.htm>Missiles Example</a>.<p>

<div>This implementation has the following characteristics:
  <ul class=sam>
    <li>The SAM pattern is implemented using 4 classes. <b>SamModel</b>, <b>SamState</b>, <b>SamActions</b> and <b>SamView</b>. When the 4 are linked together they are referred to as
    the "Model complex" or "SAM complex" internally and in this document.
    </li>
    <li>SamState, SamActions and SamView (called the "mold" internally) are readonly classes that are defined using tabular structures with no logic. As such for the most part they
    are a templated structure that is filled in with actions, states and the view HTML.<br><br>
    The exception to this tabular design are the functions that may be included in the SamActions class.
    <br><br>Since the mold components are readonly a single instance of each can be shared by multiple instances
    of the SamModel class.</li>
    <li>The SamModel instance contains the volatile information. In addition it contains pointers to the associated SamActions, SamState and SamView instances.
    If the SamModel is a child it will have a parent pointer.
    If a SamModel is a parent it will have a list of child SamModel instances.</li>
    <li>The state of the model is stored in the string <b>strState</b>. This is a deviation from the functional idea expressed by Jean-Jacques Dubray. Using a string means
    the current state can be easily shown and tested. In addition, both compile time and runtime validation can more easily be performed.</li>
    <li>A parent communicates via the <i>present</i> method of the child model. A child communicates with the parent using the <i>signal</i> method which results in a <i>present</i>
    method call to the parent model.</li>
    <li>The <i>present</i> implementation varies in a few respects from the basic implementation found in the Rocket launcher example.
      <ol>
         <li>It adds a parameter where the caller specifies what state the model is expected to be in. If this is not the case it is rejected as a concurrency error. This was found to be
         very useful in rooting out state cominations and actions that were not considered or implemented.
         </li>
         <li>The step process may or may not change the model state. It will possibly update model variable values. It can also indicate whether the next 3 processes should run with a render=true,nap=true or signal=true flag.</li>
         <li>The render process is only called if the model state changes or the render flag is true.</li>
         <li>The nextAction (nap) process is only called if it exists in the state definition and when the model state changes or the nap flag is true.</li>
         <li>The signal process is only called if it exists in the state definition and when the model state changes or the signal flag is true.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Strings are used extensively in the implementation to represent state, actions, function references. Futhermore, each string has a 2 byte prefix indication what
    type of string it is.
      <ul>
         <li><b>ss</b> - SAM state such as ssActive</li>
         <li><b>sg</b> - SAM state such as sgClosed</li>
         <li><b>sa</b> - SAM action such as saDecrement</li>
         <li><b>fn</b> - SAM function name implementing an action.</li>
      </ul>
      Internal names use a '-' as the 3rd character such as <i>ss-virgin</i> (which is the initial state of a model until the SamModel.activate() method is called).
      This prevents name clashes.
    </li>
    <li>The use of prefixed strings in this way means an editor can easily be used to locate dependencies between various pieces of code.</li>
    <li>The table driven design of the classes would lend itself to being created by a GUI engine (future).</li>
    <li>The support code validates the transitions</li>
    <li>The 'factory' used to build the Model complex validates the complex for inconsistencies such as missing states that are referenced in action codes.</li>
    <li>The HTML is generated from templates in the SamView using a slightly enhanced copy of mustache.js. This enhanced mustache.js code allows for the following.
      <ul>
         <li>Form components to be easily generated that have standard action behavoirs that are easily routed to the right SAM component.</li>
         <li>This design allows for bi-directional modeling between the SamModel value and the form component.</li>
         <li>Parameter validation is performed to root out inconsistencies such as an action name that is not implemented.</li>
         <li>A single HTML template can be varied based on the current model state or can have a comletely dirrent view.</li>
         <li>The CSS can be tightly bound to the view without incurring global intrusions (unless wanted).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>As the model runs it is conceivable to capture and replay the 'events' at the presentation layer.  This gives a simple way to test and retest such SAM complexes.</li>
  </ul>
