<h1><a href=samcas-implementation.htm><img class=hdr src=img/sam-flow.jpg></a><span class=hdr>More Complex Missiles Launcher Demonstration</span></h1>
<p>This is a variation of the <b>Rocket Launcher</b> using the methodogy proposed by Jean-Jacques Dubray at <a href=https://sam.js.org>sam.js.org</a></p>
<p>It demonstrates cascading the SAM complexes and using multiple models and singleton state, actions and views to handle multiple instances.</p>
<div>This implementation has the following characteristics
  <ul class=sam>
    <li>It uses the Rocket Launcher as a component for its launch engine and illustrates how components can be 'extended' (overidden) and customized.</li>
    <li>Uses about 450 lines of new code including the logic to customize and build the missile site. About 15% of this is template wrapper code that makes the tabular structure
    of the code easier to navigate and understand.
    </li>
    <li>It is likely this could be implemented with fewer lines using Vue components. However, this example illustrates bi-directional binding without the support structure of
   Vue.
   </li>
